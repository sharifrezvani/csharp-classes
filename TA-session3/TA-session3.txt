--------------|   Data Structures   |------------

1. Stack (پشته) =>
--------

Last in, First out:

the last item which is added, is the first item which is removed.

2. Queue (صف)=>
--------

First in (Enqueue), First out (Dequeue):

the first item which is added, is the first item which is removed.


3. Linked Lists =>
---------------

in pseudocode:

**the first part is knows as the "head"
class a
    {
        value: a;
        next: b;
    }                       
                class b
                {
                    value: b;
                    next: c;
                }
                            class c
                            {
                                value: c;
                                next: null;
                            }
                            **the last part is known as the "tail"


3. Double Linked Lists =>
----------------------

it has a head and tail just as linked lists.

but is has previous as well as next.

in pseudocode:

class a
    {
        value: a;
        next: b;
        previous: null;
    }                       
                class b
                {
                    value: b;
                    next: c;
                    previous: a;
                }
                            class c
                            {
                                value: c;
                                next: null;
                                previous: b;
                            }


LINQ =>

some keywords: select - chooses something
               from - 
               where -
               except - is kinda similar to an "else" statement
               add -
               delete -
